# Library-Project
An elementary simulation of library management system

Project started on 13 Mar 2021

This reposotary contains files across whole development period, some of them might be buggy and might harm your device, please be cautious and check them before running.


The all-in-one file is Feature-integration, which contains all functions and user interface and is able to perform most of the features, however it is not the final version of the project. The final version is located in Library Project Final as modularized files, use the makefile to compile and run. Due to the limitation of windows, the â€œbook management.h" has to be renamed as "bookmanagement.h" for successful compelling.
